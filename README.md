## Overview
App screenshots are crucial for engaging users on the App Store, Google Play, and the Chrome Store. With almost one million apps competing for user attention, studies show many consumers only browse for a few seconds before deciding whether to download an app.

## Google Play Screenshot Sizes
The Google Play Store screenshot requirements are much more flexible than those of the Apple App Store. You can define your own screenshot sizes, provided no dimension of the screenshot is less than 320 pixels or more than 3840 pixels. For example, 200x2000 is diallowed while 1000x2000 is allowed.

If you vary screenshot sizes, the maximum size should not be more than twice the minimum size.

## Number of Screenshots
The Google Play Store allows a maximum of 8 screenshots per app.

## File Format
The Google Play Store accepts either JPEG or 24-bit PNG (no alpha) images.

## Aspect Ratio
For portrait screenshots, the aspect ratio must be 2:1. For landscape screenshots, the aspect ratio must be 16:9.

# Google Play Feature Graphics
Feature graphics are required to publish an app and be featured on Google Play. The feature graphic is an opportunity to highlight compelling benefits of your app and pique interest in prospective users.

Like screenshots, feature graphics may be either JPEG or 24-bit PNG (no alpha) images.

Unlike screenshots, the dimensions for feature graphics are fixed at 1024 x 500.
